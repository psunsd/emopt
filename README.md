# EMopt
Refer to the documents [on readthedocs](https://emopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) created by Andy Michaels for details on how to install and use EMopt.  This markdown document will only contain new APIs of the GPU-EMopt.

# GPU-EMopt
The **FDTD** module, the **grid meshing** module, and part of the **gradient calculation** module are ported to CUDA C++.  To enable multi-GPU FDTD, the original FDTD control flow in fdtd.py is absorbed in C++, but the APIs exposed to users are not changed.

## Docker images hosted on dockerhub
Original CPU version:

    docker pull psunsd/emopt:2023.1.16
CUDA 12.2.0 + amd64: 

    docker pull psunsd/emopt-gpu:cuda12.2.2
CUDA 12.2.2 + arm64: 
    
    docker pull psunsd/emopt-gpu-arm64:cuda12.2.2

## FDTD module
The GPU-FDTD module is benchmarked on 13 GPU models of Volta, Turing, Ampere and Hopper architectures.  A single Tesla V100 GPU can achieve ~3x FDTD throughput as that of the CPU-EMopt on an HPE Superdome Flex S280 server with 16x 18-core CPUs.

Parallel efficiency of the GPU-FDTD module is benchmarked on a DGX-2 with 16x Tesla V100 SXM3, which are connected by all-to-all NVLink/NVSwitch fabrics.  Each GPU requires >4M FDTD nodes to effectively hide latency.  If a small simulation is distributed among too many GPUs, the latency will emerge and the paralle efficiency will drop.

The following new parameters in the initialization of emopt.fdtd.FDTD class are exposed to users:

    gpus_count: integer; number of GPUs used for FDTD; default to 1
  
    domain_decomp: char; domain decomposition direction; options are 'x', 'y', or 'z'; default to 'x'

## Grid meshing module
The following new parameters in the initialization of emopt.grid.StructuredMaterial3D are exposed to users:

    Nsubcell: integer; number of subcells per grid cell used for fas approximate calculation of polygon clipping between geometry primitive and grid cell; default to 256

The FDTD and the grid meshing modules are profiled using the NVIDIA Nsight Compute tool: both modules are compute-bound, and have achieved ~85% of GPU's peak performance.
